# AMAP on sandy: the runbook

This is the hands-on half. It sets up two Claude Code agents, each in its own
sandy sandbox, sends a real delegation between them through amap-router-local,
and then breaks each guarantee on purpose so you can see where it is enforced.

**New to AMAP?** Start with the [explainer](https://proofpoint.github.io/amap-deploy-sandy/), which covers what the
protocol guarantees, why agents run isolated, and how the pieces fit, with
animated flows. This page assumes that background and sticks to commands.

## 1. What you need

- macOS or Linux, with Docker (Docker Desktop, Rancher Desktop, Colima or
  Lima)
- Python 3.9 or later, and `jq`
- a Claude account that sandy can use (see sandy's README)
- **sandy 2.2.0 or later**. Install it and check the host:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rappdw/sandy/main/install.sh | bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rappdw/sandy/main/doctor.sh | bash
sandy --print-schema | jq '.schema_version'   # must print 3 or 4
```

## 2. Get the pieces

Clone the three repos side by side:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/amap && cd ~/amap
git clone https://github.com/proofpoint/amap-deploy-sandy
git clone https://github.com/proofpoint/amap-router-local
git clone https://github.com/proofpoint/amap-connector-claude
```

`amap-deploy-sandy` finds the other two by looking beside itself;
`$AMAP_ROUTER_REPO` and `$AMAP_CONNECTOR_REPO` override that. You do not build
the connector: `install` copies its binaries onto the read-only payload.

## 3. Make two workspaces

```sh
mkdir -p ~/amap-demo/alpha ~/amap-demo/beta
```

That is all for now. Sandy creates a workspace's sandbox at its **first
launch** (step 5) and names it with the **slug**, which looks like
`alpha-1a2b3c4d`. The slug is also the agent's name to the router and the
local part of its address. Never create a sandbox directory by hand.

Launch only after step 4 has written the manifest. Sandy decides at each
launch whether the feature selects a sandbox, against the manifest on disk,
so a sandbox launched before step 4 has to be relaunched (`sandy --stop`,
then `sandy --start`) to join.

## 4. Install

```sh
cd ~/amap/amap-deploy-sandy
python3 amap-sandy.py install --apply
```

Every verb is a dry run without `--apply`, so drop it to preview. On a fresh
host this writes the manifest at `~/.sandy/features/amap/feature.json` from
a template that **works as written**, installs the payload beside it, and
renders the router's config.

The manifest *is* the policy. Its `feature` section, as the template writes
it:

```json
"feature": {
  "version": 1,
  "groups": {},
  "default_peers": [],
  "peers": {},
  "task_graph": "ALL",
  "task_deny": [],
  "fleet_domain": "agents.internal",
  "container_recreate_interval_hours": 24
}
```

- **`task_graph: "ALL"`** lets every selected agent task every other. The
  directed form, `{"<recipient>": ["<sender>", ...]}`, appears in step 8.
- **`default_peers`, `peers` and `groups` are empty:** they are the mail
  lane, and an ordered pair may not appear on both lanes.
- **`fleet_domain`** is the right-hand side of every address, so the agents
  become `<slug>@agents.internal`. It is a name, not a real domain:
  `.internal` is reserved for private use, and nothing here touches a
  network. Give a second host its own.
- **`container_recreate_interval_hours`** is how often the agent containers
  are rebuilt, once you load the job `python3 amap-sandy.py cadence` prints.
- The top-level **`sandboxes`/`agents`** blocks are the selection rule: every
  sandbox launched with claude, none excluded.

**To narrow it**, edit the file in place and run `install --apply` again. Add
a glob to `sandboxes.exclude` to keep a sandbox out, or replace `"ALL"` with
explicit edges. A policy that names slugs (explicit `task_graph` edges,
`peers` or `groups`) needs those sandboxes to exist first, because `install`
refuses a slug sandy does not report: start them once, edit, install, and
relaunch them. `examples/feature.json` is a complete edited manifest.

## 5. Start the agents and the router

```sh
cd ~/amap-demo/alpha && sandy --start
cd ~/amap-demo/beta  && sandy --start
```

The first `--start` in a workspace creates its sandbox. At each launch sandy
evaluates the selection rule, creates the agent's lanes
under `~/.sandy/features/amap/instances/<slug>/`, mounts the payload
read-only at `/opt/sandy/features/amap`, starts the relay, and passes Claude
Code its MCP config and its system-prompt policy.

```sh
cd ~/amap/amap-router-local
docker/build.sh
docker/run.sh --config ~/.sandy/features/amap/router.json \
  --detach
```

The router's container has no network, and its mounts are computed from its
config. It re-reads the config on every poll, so later policy changes need
only `install --apply`, not a restart.

**Starting the router is the approval.** Its first poll of each agent is
*first sight*: it snapshots that agent's outbox, and never delivers anything
staged before then. Keep its state directory on persistent storage, because
a fresh one is a fresh first sight.

## 6. Verify

```sh
cd ~/amap/amap-deploy-sandy
python3 amap-sandy.py list     # both: selected
python3 amap-sandy.py verify   # exit 0 before going on
```

`verify` checks the manifest against the policy, the payload byte for byte,
each agent's lanes, relay and mounts, and last the router's container and
health. Every check is PASS, FAIL or **UNKNOWN**, and UNKNOWN counts as a
problem: it exits 1. Continue once it exits 0.

## 7. Send your first delegation

Attach to both agents, in two terminals:

```sh
cd ~/amap-demo/alpha && sandy --attach   # terminal 1
cd ~/amap-demo/beta  && sandy --attach   # terminal 2: watch it arrive
```

Ask alpha:

> Read `$AMAP_ROSTER_DIR/roster.json` and find beta's address. Then ask beta,
> through `inbox-submit`, to list the files in its workspace and report back.

Alpha finds beta in the roster and calls `submit`, which writes an inert
request into its outbox. The router checks its graph, binds the sender to
alpha's outbox, and places a notice in beta's read-only peer lane. beta's
`inbox-delivery` injects the request into beta's session, where it arrives as
a turn from the runtime-asserted sender. beta replies with `submit`; the
router binds the reply to alpha, and it arrives in alpha's session the same
way. Alpha can check the router's verdict with `submit_result`.

A delegation that is **delivered and answered** is the only proof that the
whole chain works. A started relay proves only that the daemon runs.

## 8. Break it on purpose

Each experiment breaks one property and shows you where it is enforced. None
of them damages the setup.

### The agent cannot rewrite its own tools

Open a shell in alpha's sandbox and try to change the relay:

```sh
cd ~/amap-demo/alpha && sandy --exec
touch /opt/sandy/features/amap/relay
```

The write fails with **`Read-only file system`** (`EROFS`), even though you
own the file. The same holds for the connector's binaries, the MCP config and
the policy text, and for the inbound lanes under `$AMAP_INBOX_DIR` and
`$AMAP_PEER_DIR`. Only `$AMAP_OUTBOX_DIR` is writable, and anything written
there is just a request.

### A delegation edge is directed

Change the policy so that only alpha may task beta. In the `feature` section,
using the two slugs:

```json
"task_graph": { "<beta-slug>": ["<alpha-slug>"] }
```

Run `python3 amap-sandy.py install --apply`; no restart is needed. Now ask
**beta** to start a new task for alpha, rather than reply to one. The
connector writes the request, because it holds no allowlist. The **router**
does not deliver it: beta was never granted that edge, and `submit_result`
reports the router's decision. A reply is different: a reply to a delegation
from alpha still reaches alpha, because a reply is bound to the sender.

Put `"task_graph": "ALL"` back when you are done.

### Nothing an agent does can select it

The selection rule matches the slug sandy reports, and nothing read from
inside the workspace. A repository cannot add itself to the fleet, and an
agent cannot write `~/.sandy/features/amap/` at all. To take beta out, add
its slug to `sandboxes.exclude` in the manifest, run `install --apply`, and
relaunch beta: sandy drops it from `selected.json` at that launch.

### "Could not tell" is not "fine"

```sh
docker stop amap-router-local
python3 amap-sandy.py verify; echo "exit $?"
```

The router checks report the container as not running, the health checks
report **UNKNOWN** with the reason, and `verify` exits 1. No check rounds a
question it could not answer up to a pass. Start the router again with the
`docker/run.sh` command from step 5.
